Development Process

Week 1:

After som discussion I landed on the idea of a skateboard rental service for the Oslo area.
As the title of the webpage says the goal of this service is to provide explorers of Oslo
a new way of transport and view of the city.

The webpage should serve as a promotion and information page. The goal is to increase
awareness of the service. The design should be friendly and inviting. I decieded on using
a light green, white and grey as my color base.

The site should showcase Oslo and skateboarding through the choice of images.

The information should be concise and aimed at making the user "feel" the product.



Week 2:

Feedback
I shared the first draft of the webpage to a group of student peers. The feedback I 
received was:
 - Include more information about the company
 - Provide a realistic way for the user to contact the company
 - Mix up the layout, the current layout was judged to be somewhat static and flat.

I have taken the feedback to heart and implemented the necessary changes
